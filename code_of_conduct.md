2. If a team member is unable to attend the weekly huddle due to uncontrollable circumstances, the absent team member is responsible for catching up with the team. If any team-wide decision is made during the huddle, the absent team member is understood as agreed by default, unless all other team members agree to revise the decision made.
3. If a member is unable to complete their task, they will find another task to complete instead, so that the work is still shared equally.

## Consequences

1. Warning will be given out, and based on the severity of the actions.
2. If there are issues between group members, we will discuss them first as a group and attempt to solve the issue.
3. If issues persist after discussing between the team members, the group will meet with a TA to help solve the conflict as a group.
